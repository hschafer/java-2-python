# Java-2-Python

This repository contains iPython Notebooks to learn Python assuming the reader already has knowledge of the programming langauge Java.
The main idea behind this guide is to teach Python leveraging past knowledge of Java to make learning easier.

This version of the guide is written for Python 3 and is targetted to students at the University of Washington taking CSE/STAT 416. Turicreate was not available for Python 2 in previous years and the staff had decided to switch from Turi to Pandas and Scikitlearn for SP19. Therefore this version of the guide has been updated to Python 3 and is targetted to students at the University of Washington taking CSE/STAT 416.
